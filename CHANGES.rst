Changes
========

1.1 (unreleased)
------------------

- Add a new ObjectDataManager that will attempt to execute after
  other ObjectDataManagers.


1.0.0 (2016-07-28)
------------------

- Add support for Python 3.
- Eliminate ZODB dependency. Instead of raising a
  ``ZODB.POSException.StorageError`` for unexpected ``TypeErrors``
  during commit, the new class
  ``nti.transactions.interfaces.CommitFailedError`` is raised.
- Introduce a new subclass of ``TransactionError``,
  ``AbortFailedError`` that is raised when an abort fails due to a
  system error.
